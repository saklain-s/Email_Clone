## More Detail



I have created my project based on how email works. Firstly, a login page pops up. If you already have a registered email account, you can log in directly. After logging into your account, you can compose an email to anyone you want. After composing, you can check your inbox; it will show you the emails that you have sent. There's also an option for a reply button, in which you can edit the message that you have already sent
